Using `AdapterViews` has never been so easy. Inspired by the [view holder](http://developer.android.com/training/improving-layouts/smooth-scrolling.html#ViewHolder) design pattern, this library provides an easier way of linking `AdapterViews` and the underlying data for that view without having to implement your own Adapter. The `EasyAdapter` will do the tedious work for you.
